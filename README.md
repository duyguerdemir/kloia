This is the repository for the task given by Kloia to automate some of the features from "wwww.n11.com"
The framework is established on "Maven-Selenium-Cucumber-JUnit" test automation tools based on Page Object Model and the programming language is Java.

This framework generates both  an html report and a json report.

For the API testing, after manually testing each scenerio in Postman, RestAssured library is used for automation.
